## Quiz game written in Python.

 Upon start the game welcomes a player and asks for players name. After introduction and welcoming, a player is asked to choose a difficulty.
 Depending on chosen difficulty the game displays a text with blank fields. A player is asked to fill in the current blank field and displays a text with the guessed word.
 Player has several tries to guess a word. If a word is guessed correctly the program prompts a player to the next blank field. Upon winning or loss, the program reacts
 accordingly and offers to start a new game.
